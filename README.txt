Opens the options page of an extension or app from the address bar. Type 'opt', a space or tab, the name of the extension or app, and return. If you leave out the name of an extension/app or enter an extension/app that does not have an options page, it opens the extensions page. If you're on a Mac, you can use control-n and control-p to navigate the drop-down suggestion list.
